# Breast Cancer Important Features
For this project I used a linear regression model to identify the most important features indicative of breast cancer. An exhaustive Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to identify and remove duplicate entries and outliers. There are few missing values that were safely removed as well. Finally a heatmap plot showed highly correlated features that were handled first before the implemetation of the learning algorithm
